# Fozzie Components Documentation

This is a _mono-repo_.  It contains several packages, all controlled from a top level `packages.json`.

Each project has its own `package.json` file containing package specific configuration, **however** don't run `yarn install` from a package project; instead run it from the top level.

If you run `yarn install` from a package then you may well get an unhelpful error like this:

```none
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, symlink '…\fozzie-components\packages\…' -> '…\fozzie-components\node_modules\@justeat\…'
```

If this happens, delete all the `node_modules` folders throughout and then run `yarn install` from the root directory again.
