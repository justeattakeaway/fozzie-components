# UI Component Mono-repo

## Introduction

A mono-repo is a single repository containing multiple packages – in our case UI components and services. 

Using multi-package repository reduces the time and space requirements for numerous copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. Updating common configuration across components is also much simpler as these dependencies can be shared and updated from the root of the mono-repo; for example linting or test dependencies.

Each individual component can be found in the [`components`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components) directory, and are all controlled from a top level `packages.json`.

## Folder Structure

The mono-repo folder structure has been organised to differentiate between several distinct types of packages. These are:

- Components
- Services
- Tools

### Components

UI components written in Vue.js, which can be pulled into a Vue application as a shared library component.

Components are organised into sub-folders loosely matching the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), such as **Atoms**, **Molecules** and **Organisms**.

As a rough guide:
- **Atom** = Basic building blocks of an application.
- **Molecule** = A group of component atoms that form a small fundamental component.
- **Organism** = A group of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

As a general rule, if a component depends on another UI component (for example, it contains a `button` component), it will be at the very least a molecule in size. Atoms by their definition are the simplest form of components.

### Services

Services are packages that are written solely in JavaScript and provide a distinct piece of client-side or middleware functionality.

For instance, it would make sense to write a specific package to handle how components handle globalisation and internationalisation via the Vue i18n module – and we have a package that does just that (`f-globalisation`).

We currently have a shared package called `f-services` which defines a number of client-side utility services that components can make use of.

### Tools

Tools are packages that are used to provide a specific piece of functionality that is used by components or more generally in the mono-repo.

Currently, we have the following tools:

- [`f-vue-icons`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/tools/f-vue-icons) – Provides an interface for our Vue components to use icons defined in  the [`f-icons` package](https://github.com/justeat/f-icons).
- [`generator-component`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/tools/generator-component) – A yeoman generator that should be used when creating new packages to provide a base folder structure to start from.
- [`storybook`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/tools/storybook) – Our component library documentation tool that allows us to preview and test components in isolation before being integrated into JE web applications.

## Naming your packages in the mono-repo

The general naming convention for a Fozzie package is to use `f-{your-package-name}` e.g. [`f-footer`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components/organisms/f-footer), [`f-header`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components/organisms/f-header), [`f-checkout`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components/organisms/f-checkout).

## Badges for README.md

### General Badges (should be added to all packages)

* npm version badge from [badge.fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/)

### Optional Badges

* To report the build status you can [add a CircleCI badge](https://circleci.com/gh/justeat/workflows/fozzie-components)
* If there are JavaScript unit tests in the package you can [add a coveralls badge](https://coveralls.io/github/justeat/)
* Check for known vulnerabilities in your package with a [Snyk.io badge](https://snyk.io/test/)

## Publishing to npm

To publish a package to **npm**, please first ensure that you have registered an account.
Internal contributors (Just Eat employees) can request to be added to the Just Eat npm org by asking in the #guild-ui Slack channel and providing your npm account details. External contributors should raise a pull request and the release will be handled for you once approved.

Once you are happy that the package is ready to be published to the npm registry, ensure you are on the correct branch — typically the master branch with the latest changes pulled — then run `npm publish` on the command line.
