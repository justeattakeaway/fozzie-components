# UI Component Mono-repo

## Introduction

A mono-repo is a single repository containing multiple packages – in our case UI components and services.

Using multi-package repository reduces the time and space requirements for numerous copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. Updating common configuration across components is also much simpler as these dependencies can be shared and updated from the root of the mono-repo; for example linting or test dependencies.

Each individual component can be found in the [`components`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components) directory, and are all controlled from a top level `packages.json`.

## Dependencies

For more information on the dependencies needed when including these shared UI components as part of your application, check out our <LinkTo kind="Documentation/Setup Guides/Dependencies" story="page">Component Dependency guide</LinkTo>.

## Folder Structure

The mono-repo folder structure has been organised to differentiate between several distinct types of packages. These are:

- Components
- Services
- Tools

### Components

UI components written in Vue.js, which can be pulled into a Vue application as a shared library component.

Components are organised into sub-folders loosely matching the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), such as **Atoms**, **Molecules** and **Organisms**.

As a rough guide:
- **Atom** = Basic building blocks of an application.
- **Molecule** = A group of component atoms that form a small fundamental component.
- **Organism** = A group of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

As a general rule, if a component depends on another UI component (for example, it contains a `button` component), it will be at the very least a molecule in size. Atoms by their definition are the simplest form of components.

### Services

Services are packages that are written solely in JavaScript and provide a distinct piece of client-side or middleware functionality.

For instance, it would make sense to write a specific package to handle how components handle globalisation and internationalisation via the Vue i18n module – and we have a package that does just that (`f-globalisation`).

We currently have a shared package called `f-services` which defines a number of client-side utility services that components can make use of.

### Tools

Tools are packages that are used to provide a specific piece of functionality that is used by components or more generally in the mono-repo.

Currently, we have the following tools:

- [`f-vue-icons`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/tools/f-vue-icons) – Provides an interface for our Vue components to use icons defined in  the [`f-icons` package](https://github.com/justeat/f-icons).
- [`generator-component`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/tools/generator-component) – A yeoman generator that should be used when creating new packages to provide a base folder structure to start from.
- [`storybook`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/tools/storybook) – Our component library documentation tool that allows us to preview and test components in isolation before being integrated into JE web applications.

## Naming your packages in the mono-repo

The general naming convention for a Fozzie package is to use `f-{your-package-name}` e.g. [`f-footer`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components/organisms/f-footer), [`f-header`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components/organisms/f-header), [`f-checkout`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components/organisms/f-checkout).

## Badges for README.md

### General Badges (should be added to all packages)

* npm version badge from [badge.fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/)

### Optional Badges

* To report the build status you can [add a CircleCI badge](https://circleci.com/gh/justeat/workflows/fozzie-components)
* If there are JavaScript unit tests in the package you can [add a coveralls badge](https://coveralls.io/github/justeat/)
* Check for known vulnerabilities in your package with a [Snyk.io badge](https://snyk.io/test/)
