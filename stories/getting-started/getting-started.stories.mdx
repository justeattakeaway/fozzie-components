# UI Component Mono-repo

## Introduction

A mono-repo is a single repository containing multiple packages – in our case UI components and services.

Using multi-package repository reduces the time and space requirements for numerous copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. Updating common configuration across components is also much simpler as these dependencies can be shared and updated from the root of the mono-repo; for example linting or test dependencies.

Each individual component can be found in the [`components`](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/tree/master/packages/components) directory, and are all controlled from a top level `packages.json`.
