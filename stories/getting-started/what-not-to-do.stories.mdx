# What not to do guide

Here is a list of common mistakes we see in submitted PRs. Avoiding them will help us to review PRs quicker.

* **Don’t add `^` to dependencies.**

  As a standard we have strict versioning for all the project's dependencies.

* **Don’t commit in yalc dependencies in package.json files.**

  Yalc is a great tool for local testing but don't forget to switch back to published version of the dependencies when you finished testing.

* **Don’t use internal projects references in your PRs:**

  Fozzie-components is an open source repo and can't have internal projects references in it
  * Don't link private github repos in PR’s or comments. 
  * Don’t link to organisational tools (such as links to our private task management tickets).
