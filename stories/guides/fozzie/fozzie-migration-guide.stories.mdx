# Fozzie version 9 Migration guide

If you are upgrading from an older version of fozzie – i.e v8 and older – then this migration guide will help you update to the latest version (v9) which uses `dart-sass` as opposed to `node-sass`.

<a name="prerequisites"></a><h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Before you get started with the Fozzie SCSS helper library there are a few things you need to know in order to get up and running.

From v9 and above, you'll need the following:

1. [dart-sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass):
    - Fozzie makes use of new SCSS syntax to compile your Sass (namely `@use` & `@forward`). The [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) module now uses `dart-sass` by default, so if you use the latest version of this module, you'll be fine.
2. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (or a similar file bundler)
    - For file resolution paths into the `node_modules` folder. If you aren't using Webpack, then you can use something like [ParcelJs](https://parceljs.org/) instead, which also supports this.

<a name="removing-node-sass"></a><h2>Removing node-sass in favour of sass</h2>

If you use Node Sass, migrating to Dart Sass is straightforward; just replace `node-sass` in your `package.json` file with `sass`. Both packages expose the same JavaScript API.

```
// Package.json example

Before:
---
{
  "name": "Example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Example",
  "devDependencies": {
    "node-sass": "5.0.0", << Old node-sass.
  }
}

After:
---
{
  "name": "Example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Example",
  "devDependencies": {
    "sass": "1.52.3", << node-sass changed for `sass`
  }
}
```

If you have an old version of `fozzie` installed within your application at this point, you will likely see some syntax errors. In order to resolve these issue you will need to move to `v9` of `fozzie` which currently sits in [beta](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@justeat/fozzie/v/9.0.0-beta.5).
This version of `fozzie` contains changes which will automatically resolve those errors.

<a name="scheme"></a><h2>How to move from `@import` to `@use` & `@forward`</h2>

Once you have moved over to `dart-sass` and switched to the new version of fozzie (v9). You can begin to update your application with the new `@use` & `@forward` syntax. If you are unfamiliar with how `@use` & `@forward` work there's a useful video found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0&ab_channel=KevinPowell) worth watching first.

Assuming a common Vue application structure, we will look at each individually:

```
┣ layouts
    ┣ default.vue
    ┣ anotherPage.vue
┣ assets
    ┣ scss
        ┣ common.scss
```

### Common.scss

```
┣ assets
    ┣ scss
        ┣ common.scss
```

You may have a file like `common.scss` that contains all of the shared styles required throughout an application. If this is the case, you should have a setup like below which effectively imports `fozzie` and other helper files, making them globally available throughout the application.

#### Old way (@import):
```
@import '~@justeat/fozzie/src/scss/fozzie';

@include normalize();
@include reset();
@include typography();
@include links();
@include trumps-utilities();
```

#### New way (@use / @forward):

Using the new `@use`/`@forward` syntax, we can change the above to the following:

```
@use '~@justeat/fozzie/src/scss/fozzie' as f;

@include f.normalize();
@include f.reset();
@include f.typography();
@include f.links();
@include f.trumps-utilities();
```

`Note` the namespacing references, you can read more [on how namespacing works here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#choosing-a-namespace).

If you have scss files like a header and footer shared across your application stored in your `common.scss` directory, then you would simply `@forward` these on to be used within the Vue single file component like so:

```
// common.scss

@forward '@justeat/f-header/dist/f-header.css';
@forward '@justeat/f-footer/dist/f-footer.css';


// Single File Component (SFC)
// default.vue

<style lang="scss">
@use '../assets/scss/common';
</style>

```

<a name="vue-config"></a><h2>Vue config</h2>

Your application may load in a `common.scss` file at the `vue.config` level (see below) & [here](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/blob/master/packages/components/organisms/f-header/vue.config.js#L21). If that's the case you can still make use of `@use`:

```
// vue.config.js (webpack)

module.exports = {
    chainWebpack: config => {
        config.module
            .options({
                additionalData: `@use "../assets/scss/common.scss";`
            });
    }
};


// Usage within a SFC

<style lang="scss">
.c-footer {
  @include common.background-color($btn-primary-bgColor);
}
</style>
```

<a name="gulp-migration"></a><h2>If you're coming from Gulp</h2>

If your application uses a different build tool other than webpack (see [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above) such as [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). This section will cover the steps you need to complete in-order to migrate successfully.

#### Gulp Build Fozzie:

[Gulp build fozzie](https://github.com/justeat/gulp-build-fozzie) is a (now deprecated) set of Gulp tasks that can be used to build Fozzie modules. If your application uses this to bundle your project, instead of Webpack, you will firstly need to update to the latest version of `gulp-build-fozzie` (v11.0.0). Version 11.0.0 is compatible with the latest versions of fozzie (v9+), removing support for a package called eyeglass which essentially creates a shortcut to your `node_modules` folder.

The following changes need to happen once you've updated gulp-build-fozzie to v11 or greater:
1. Bump `fozzie` to the latest major version (v9), see changelog for details.
2. If you are using `node-sass` then you will need to change over to use `dart-sass` this is as simple as changing it to `sass` within your `package.json`.
3. Within your application you will need to update some of the fozzie paths to follow the new `@use/@forward` rules, see [here](#new-way-use--forward) for more details.
    - Essentially:
        `import 'fozzie';` changes to `'@justeat/fozzie/src/scss/fozzie' as f;`
4. With the new `@use` change above you will now need to update your entire application so `fozzie` helpers can be accessed correctly. See [example](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/pull/2033) PR.
5. Run your application build command to make sure there are no errors in your app.
