# Fozzie & Sass

Fozzie is Just Eat's UI Component Framework, built to help modularise and share the UI code we write across all of our teams at Just Eat.

Before you get started with fozzie there's a few things you need to know to get up and running. If you are coming to fozzie from an older version of fozzie i.e v8 and older then this migration [guide](www.google.co.uk) will help you migrate to the latest version. Once you have migrated you can come back here and read what's new.

Consuming application must have the following in-order to run fozzie version 9 and above:

1. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
    - For file resolution paths. If you aren't using webpack then you can use something like [ParcelJs](https://parceljs.org/) instead.
2. [dart-sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass):
    - To compile your Sass, required for the new syntax (`@use` & `@forward`) used in version 9 of fozzie. The [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) module uses dart-sass by default now, so if you use the latest version of this module, you'll be fine.

Fozzie SCSS styles uses webpack to resolve file path names, rather than having to provide absolute paths into the node_modules folder. If you don't have webpack running you can use other tools like [ParcelJs](https://parceljs.org/) see migration [guide](www.google.co.uk) for more information.

### How to add and use fozzie within your project

For example, say you have a project and want to include the base fozzie module in your Sass build, you can do the following:

1. Install the base module using NPM or Yarn.

```
// Yarn example

yarn add @justeat/fozzie
```

2. Within your project Sass files, you will then be able to import and use the base fozzie module like so:

```
// Basic usage

@use 'fozzie';

.c-breadcrumbs {
  @include fozzie.breadcrumbs();
  background-color: fozzie.$color-blue;
}
```

3. A moduleâ€™s namespace is just the last component of its URL without a file extension. So in the previous example you can see that `@use 'fozzie'` will be namespaced to `fozzie`, this happens by default. You can however choose to give a custom namespace with `@use` statements like so:

```
// Namespacing usage

@use 'fozzie' as f;

.c-breadcrumbs {
  @include f.breadcrumbs();
  background-color: f.$color-blue;
}
```

### Once set up and running

When your Sass is compiled, it will include the Sass from the fozzie module as well.
