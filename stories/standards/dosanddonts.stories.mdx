# Do's & Don'ts

## What is this?

We, as a team, need to adhere to a standardised approach to development so that our codebase does not become a mashup of various styles which would make it very difficult to maintain, read, extend, etc.

These standards may be based on important things like efficiency, best practice, readability, security, etc. but could also be based on more trivial factors such as '*preferred approach*'.
This then allows us to revisit the codebase time and time again without having to reacquaint ourselves with the codebase.

Below is a list of 'do's and don'ts' that we, as a team, have agreed to adhere to. These items will be reviewed regularly by the team due to the changing landscape of the technologies we use.

If you want to add, edit or remove any of the items below then please start up a discussion in our [GIT repository](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/discussions), share it in our Slack channel (*#guild-frontend*) and based on the outcome of that discussion, make changes to the list below.

## Do's

1. Create/Place unit test files close to the logic in a folder called **`_tests`**.   If the tests are global to the component then create/place unit test files in a folder on the root called **`test`** ([discussion](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-components/discussions/1171)).

## Don'ts
