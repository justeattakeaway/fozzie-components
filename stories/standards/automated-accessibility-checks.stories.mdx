# Automated Accessibility Checks

To find and fix problems earlier we added automated accessibility checks to our development process. At the moment we run axe core tests as part of out CI build and `eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility` for linting checks.

## Axe Core tests
These checks are not blocking the build but fire as warnings. They can be found under `test/accessibility/axe-accessibility.spec.js` for every component.

In order to see if there are any a11y issues, you can either:

- Start storybook locally (`yarn build:storybook` > `yarn storybook:serve-static`)
- run the a11y test (`yarn test-a11y:chrome`)

or on CircleCI, look at your build and see if there are any `.csv` files on the artefact tab, like [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/justeat/fozzie-components/4547/workflows/7df6a3be-0284-4838-a21f-7807441907c3/jobs/5998/artifacts).

## eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility

This runs accessibility checks as part of our ESLint checks. These do not block the build but fire as warnings. You will see them in the console when running a `yarn build` of the component you are working on.
