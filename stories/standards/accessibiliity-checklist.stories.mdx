# Accessibility Checklist

## HTML is valid

Paste your markup into a validator a fix any reported issues. As well as reporting markup issues, the W3C Markup Validation Service will also report incorrect use of ARIA attributes.

### Tools
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Learn more
- [Why Validate?](https://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html#why_pros)


## HTML is well structured

Think about the structure of the tags you're using. Are elements like `header` and `section` used appropriately? Are headings structured in a logical order according to level of importance? Have the correct type of lists been used? i.e. ordered / unordered.

### Tools
- Use the [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) to analyse the document outline.

- [HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element)


## HTML is well ordered

Turn off CSS and read the page from top to bottom. Is it possible to read the document? Does it make sense?

Use heading order to show importance.

### Tools
- Use the [Web Developer Toolbar](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) to disable CSS (look in the CSS tab).
- Use the [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) to analyse the document outline.


## HTML is semantic

Ensure semantics are conveyed with tags or roles (if necessary), not with style. E.g. `em` not `class="italic"` and `button` or `role="button"` not `div`.

##Â HTML is labelled

Controls and images must be labelled.

Form elements should have an associated `label`, even those with `placeholder`, and the label must always be visible. Alternatively they may make use of ARIA attributes such as `aria-described-by` or `aria-label`.

Images must have an `alt` attribute, even if it's empty. Think about the context of the image; is it followed by descriptive text? Is it contained within a link? Is it a decorative image?

## Passed an accessibility audit

Run an in-browser audit and fix any issues.

Paste your markup into a validator such as the [Web Accessibility Checker](http://achecker.ca/checker/) and fix any reported issues. The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) will also report some accessibility related issues.

## Keyboard is supported

Using only the keyboard, check the following.

- You should be able to action links and buttons with Space or Enter
- Dialogues may be dismissed and menus closed with Escape
- Composite components (such as dropdown menus) support arrow keys.

Follow the conventions in native web components.

## Tab stops in place

Using only the keyboard, you should be able to navigate to every interactive element (and *only* interactive elements) with the Tab key. Use `tabindex="0"` on interactive elements that aren't natively focusable.

### Reference
- [HTML 5.1 - The tabindex attribute](http://w3c.github.io/html/editing.html#the-tabindex-attribute)


## Focus is managed

Using only the keyboard, interact with any scripted components and ensure focus is never 'dropped'. For example opening a dialogue (Space or Enter) focusses a button within that dialogue, dismissing the dialogue (Escape) hands focus back to the element which opened it.

### Reference
- [WAI-ARIA - Managing Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#managingfocus)


## States are updated

Examine the live DOM (devtools) and manipulate the site (open, close, expand elements). Any states, such as `aria-valuenow` and `aria-expanded`, update accordingly.

### Reference
- [Definitions of States and Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#state_prop_def)
- [Allowed ARIA roles, states and properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#allowed-aria-roles-states-and-properties)


## Page is well spoken

Use the site with a screen reader (and if you can, switch off your monitor).

Landmarks mean it is easy to navigate the page. Semantic elements and attributes tell a meaningful story. Dynamic content is spoken as a live region. All content and functionality is available without seeing or using a mouse/trackpad.

## Examples

### Adding text for assistive software

Use a class helper to hide text visually:

```markup
<button>Add <span class="is-visuallyHidden">burger to basket</span></button>
```

When you have an element which uses a graphic to indicate its purpose, make sure you label it as such.

```markup
<button aria-label="Add burger to basket">Add</button>
```

*Only the `aria-label` value will be used*
