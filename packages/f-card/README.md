## Usage

1.  Install the module using NPM or Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add @justeat/f-card
    ```

    ```bash
    npm install @justeat/f-card
    ```

2.  Import the component

    You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

    ```
    import CardComponent from '@justeat/f-card';
    import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';

    export default {
        components: {
            CardComponent
        }
    }
    ```

    If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the header bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

    ```
    import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';

    export default {
        components: {
            ...
            CardComponent: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "vue-card" */ '@justeat/f-card')
        }
    }

    ```

## Development

Running below `yarn` commands from the component folder, starts a development
server displaying a preview example of the component implementation.

```bash
# cd /packages/f-card
yarn install

# followed by
yarn demo
```

### Storybook

The component is also available to demo through our storybook instance which can be served locally by running `yarn storybook:serve` from the mono-repo root.


## Props

`f-card` has a number of props that allow you to customise its functionality.

The props that can be defined are as follows:

| locale                    | false          | `string`      | `en-GB` | Sets the locale of the component (which determines what theme and translations to use.<br><br>If the application consuming the `f-card` component is using the vue `i18n` module, then the locale from that module will be used when this prop isn't defined. When this prop is defined, it takes precedence over the locale defined by the `i18n` module.<br><br>If not defined and the `i18n` module isn't present, the default locale used is `en-GB`.|
| isRounded                | false           | `boolean`     | `false` | When set to `true`, rounded corners are applied to the card component. |
| hasOutline               | false           | `boolean`     | `false` | When set to `true`, an outline is applied to the card component.  |
| isPageContentWrapper     | false           | `boolean`     | `false` | When set to `true`, applies styles to make the card act like a page content wrapper.<br><br>The card will be full width on narrow devices, and then a fixed width above a certain breakpoint width (about 480px), when the card will be centred on the page. |
