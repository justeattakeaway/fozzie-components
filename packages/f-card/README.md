## Usage

1.  Install the module using NPM or Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add @justeat/f-card
    ```

    ```bash
    npm install @justeat/f-card
    ```

2.  Import the component

    You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

    ```
    import CardComponent from '@justeat/f-card';
    import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';

    export default {
        components: {
            CardComponent
        }
    }
    ```

    If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the header bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

    ```
    import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';

    export default {
        components: {
            ...
            CardComponent: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "vue-card" */ '@justeat/f-card')
        }
    }

    ```

## Development

Running below `yarn` commands from the component folder, starts a development
server displaying a preview example of the component implementation.

```bash
# cd /packages/f-card
yarn install

# followed by
yarn demo
```

### Storybook

The component is also available to demo through our storybook instance which can be served locally by running `yarn storybook:serve` from the mono-repo root.
