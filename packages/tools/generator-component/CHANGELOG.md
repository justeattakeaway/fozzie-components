v2.0.0
------------------------------
*January 27, 2021*

### Added
- `.yo-rc.json` to signify the destination root of the generator (to use the base of the mono-repo as our root directory, wherever the generator is run).
- Generator will now generate to a destination based on the users answers. For example, if it's specified that the component is an atom, the component will be generated into the `components/atoms` directory.
- Welcome prompt and update prompt which displays if the generator being run is out-of-date with the current published version.
- Option to exclude translations/`i18n` config when component doesn't need these.
- Excludes a number of directories and code when generated component is a service.

### Fixed
- `yeoman-generator` added to dependencies so that local testing doesn't error on missing dependency.

### Changed
- Structure of generator tidied up. Now uses `initializing` and `configuring` contexts rather than having all logic in the `writing` context.
- Prompts moved out into separate file.
- `_tests` folder updated (previously `tests`).
