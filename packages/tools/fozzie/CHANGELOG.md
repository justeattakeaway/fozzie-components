# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

## v11.2.1

_April 10, 2024_

### Changed

- Update `jest` to latest version.


## v11.2.0

_April 10, 2024_

### Changed

- `@justeat/pie-design-tokens` from 5.0.0 to 6.2.1

## v11.1.0

_March 13, 2024_

### Fixed

- node engines in `package.json` to include all versions above 14

## Future Todo List

- Make typography and utility classes silent extenders (so that they can be extended by components without importing all utility classes).

## v11.0.2

_November 8, 2023_

### Changed

- `include-media` reference to released 2.0.0 version.

## v11.0.1

_September 5, 2023_

### Changed

- Update test snapshot

## v11.0.0

_March 27, 2023_

### Changed

- Update focus styles to new double outline, using box-shadow.
  - To prevent anti-aliasing issues when used with rounded borders, the two shadows had to be separated into separate declarations.
  - The inner shadow is applied to the element and the outer shadow to the `:after` pseudo-element.
  - Deprecated `%u-elementFocus--boxShadow` as all focus styles should use box-shadow by default.
    - `%u-elementFocus` now sets `outline: none` by default.

### Added

- `%u-elementFocus--borderless` for elements that do not have a border.
  - The default `%u-elementFocus` extender assumes the element will have a 1px border, so this extender repositions the `:after` pseudo-element slightly.
  - `position: relative` is also applied to the element by default (to anchor the position of the `:after` pseudo-element) so if you need a different value please override it.

### Removed

- `$btn-default-outline-color` SCSS variable. This shouldn't be being used elsewhere, but if it is then please use the silent extenders to get the focus styles instead.

## v10.11.1

  !!Note: If you don't use `$includeBaseFramework` or `$includeMinimalFramework` vars and want to have normalize styles in you project, you need to `@include normalize()` mixin starting from this version.

## v5.0.0

_August 23, 2021_

## Main changes:

- Colour and typography variables updated to use `pie-design-tokens` repo instead of `fozzie-colour-palette`.
- When importing v5 fozzie, consuming applications only get included variables, functions and mixins (no classes). Component styles for buttons, form-fields etc are being deprecated as we move our components over to versionable packages, but can still be included via optional mixins applications that still need this as part of the transition.
- Two optional variables can be used to include a base set of styles (similar to v4). These are `$includeBaseFramework` and `$includeMinimalFramework`. Check out the `_templates.scss` file to see what styles are included when these are set to true.

### Changed

- Eyeglass version bumped to v3.
- Made all styles and components optional (wrapped in a mixin).
- Lots of colour variables moved over as part of using the new `pie-design-tokens` repo instead of `fozzie-colour-palette`.
- Updated type-map with new typography variables for font-size and line-height.

### Removed

- `/settings/glyphs` moved into badges, as it is the only place it is used.
- `/images` as not used.
- `kickoff-grid` dependency brought into fozzie, to remove external dependency (making it easier to change if needed).
- `$font-weight-bold` was removed as it now comes straight from `pie-design-tokens`.
