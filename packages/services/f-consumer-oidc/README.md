This library allows consumer microsites to obtain tokens for interacting with HTTP APIs via Smart Gateway.

## Usage

To install directly in a microsite:

```
npm install @justeat/f-consumer-oidc js-cookie
```

This library has a required `peerDependency` on `js-cookie` (to help reduce the bundle size).

There is also a requirement that an `Oidc` client object is passed into the exported functions below, this can come from the [`oidc-client`](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki) npm package or another source i.e. a global variable e.g.

```javascript
import OidcClient from 'oidc-client';

const OidcClient = window.Oidc;
```

To use within a package, it is recommended to install this as a _peer_ dependency.  This is because the module holds some state to remember the status of logins.  For example if two packages hosted by the same microsite both wanted to get a user token, you wouldn't want them both to go through the whole signin procedure.

The exports are:

### 1. `silentSignIn`

This function attempts to get a valid JWT for the current user.  It works as follows:

* it stores the token in a cookie (`je-oidc`), so if the user has already done this in their session it will retrieve that
* for the page lifetime (i.e. JS variable) it remembers if the user is not logged in, so that it doesn't attempt to get a token repeatedly
* by default it will silently refresh the token close to its expiry time, if possible.  This functionality is built in to [`oidc-client`](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki).

Usage:

```javascript
import { silentSignIn } from `@justeat/f-consumer-oidc`;

silentSignIn(OidcClient, optionalSettings, force)
    .then((token) => /* will be a valid JWT for use in Auth header or null if user not logged in */ )
    .catch((error) => /* ... */);
```

* `OidcClient` is an instance of the `oidc-client` npm package which needs to be injected in from the consuming application.

  The client is injected in this way to avoid users downloading the client twice; once from the consuming application and then again from the iframe web page.
* `optionalSettings` can override the settings that initialise the `UserManager` object from the [`oidc-client`](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki#usermanager) library.
* `force` is an optional flag that can be provided to force the signin process to begin, regardless of the current state (defaults to false).

### 2. `userManagerFactory`

This function returns a `UserManager` object from the [`oidc-client`](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki#usermanager) library,
configured for use in Just Eat.

Usage:
```javascript
import { userManagerFactory } from `@justeat/f-consumer-oidc`;

var userManager = userManagerFactory(OidcClient, optionalSettings);
```
