v0.5.0
------------------------------
*May 26, 2020*

### Added
- `Vuelidate` package added for validation of form inputs. Validation currently set-up to show to form submission.
- Error messages for error states and styling for error messages (needs to be in the form rather than on the input because of the way CSS Modules works â€“ the plan will be to move this styling to a more generic `f-form` component down the line).
- `name` attributes added to each form field component.
- Added base `typography` file to the demo component so that it shows how the component will look with the global fozzie typographic styles applied (global styles like this will be made available as a separate include that is imported into each component in the future).

### Changed
- Stubbed `.css` file module imports as was causing build error.
