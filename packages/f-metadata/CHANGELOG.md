v2.3.1
------------------------------
*April 3, 2020*

v2.1.0
------------------------------
*February 18, 2020*

### Changed
- Call `handleContentCards` with an empty array if no content cards are available, enabling any side effects once Braze is called.


v2.0.0
------------------------------
*February 10, 2020*

### Changed
- Callback methods are now called with the whole appboy instance ensuring functionality is available on the appboy instance whenever a refresh is called.

*January  29, 2020*

### Changed
- Bumped `appboy-web-sdk` because of a known `contentCard` issue in 2.4.0

### Removed
- `requestContentCardsRefresh()` unnecessary call.

### Fixed
- `ContentCard` - Not displaying on initial first load due to appboy `sync`
calls happening before the sdk is ready to update the
`ab.storage.cc.[api-key]` in localStorage. Now using `subscribeToContentCardsUpdates` to listen
for updates.
