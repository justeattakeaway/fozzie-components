## Usage

### Installation

This package can be installed using npm or yarn:

```sh
yarn add @justeat/f-card
```

```sh
npm install @justeat/f-card
```

### Vue Applications

You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

```js
import CardComponent from '@justeat/f-card';
import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';

export default {
    components: {
        CardComponent
    }
}
```

If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the `f-card` bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

```js
import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';

export default {
    components: {
        ...
        CardComponent: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "vue-card" */ '@justeat/f-card')
    }
}

```
