# f-card-with-content

<img width="125" alt="Fozzie Bear" src="../../../../bear.png" />

A page content card which can contain an image, heading, text, and (primary and secondary) buttons.
The purpose of this component is to offer a reusable card with a common layout.
This may also potentially prevent the need for a consuming component to directly reference `f-card`, `f-button`, and define the layout itself.

The icon can be any image but it is recommended to use an icon from `f-vue-icons`, e.g., one of the bag icons.

## Usage

### Installation

Install the module using npm or Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @justeat/f-card-with-content
```

```sh
npm install @justeat/f-card-with-content
```

The package also has dependencies that need to be installed by consuming components/applications:

| Dependency | Command to install | Styles to include |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| f-button | `yarn add @justeat/f-button` | `import '@justeat/f-button/dist/f-button.css';` |
| f-card | `yarn add @justeat/f-card` | `import '@justeat/f-card/dist/f-card.css';` |


### Vue Applications

You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

```js
import CardWithContent from '@justeat/f-card-with-content';
import '@justeat/f-card-with-content/dist/f-card-with-content.css';

export default {
    components: {
        CardWithContent
    }
}
```

If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the `card-with-content` bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

```js
import '@justeat/f-card-with-content/dist/f-card-with-content.css';

export default {
    components: {
        // â€¦
        CardWithContent: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "card-with-content" */ '@justeat/f-card-with-content')
    }
}
```
