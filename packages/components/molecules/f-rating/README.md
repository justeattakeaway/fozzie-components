## Usage

### Installation

Install the module using npm or Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @justeat/f-rating
```

```sh
npm install @justeat/f-rating
```



### Vue Applications

You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

```js
import VRating from '@justeat/f-rating';
import '@justeat/f-rating/dist/f-rating.css';

export default {
    components: {
        VRating
    }
}
```

If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the `v-rating` bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

```js
import '@justeat/f-rating/dist/f-rating.css';

export default {
    components: {
        // â€¦
        VRating: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "v-rating" */ '@justeat/f-rating')
    }
}
```

|:--------------------|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `starRating`        | `Number`  |   Yes    |    -    | Sets the displayed rating (filled stars). i.e. for `2 out of x`, 2 would be the `starRating`                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | -
| `maxStarRating`     | `Number`  |    No    |    5    | Sets the maximum number of stars that the rating is set against. i.e. for `x out of 5`, 5 would be the `maxStarRating` You can use any number of stars, so if you currently need 6 all you have to do is pass in 6.                                                                                          | -
| `starRatingSize`    | `String`  |    No    | 'small' | Sets the component size. By default the component will use `small`. `Note:` If you find that the size you currently use doesn't fall into one for the four size options here then please move up to the next available size. e.g if you use 22px as your rating size then you should move to 24px (`medium`) | `xsmall = 16px` `small = 20px` `medium = 24px` `large = 32px`
| `ratingDisplayType` | `String`  |    No    |  null   | Sets the descriptive text which will be displayed next to the component. By default there will be no text.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `short` `medium` `long`
| `reviewCount`       | `Number`  |    No    |  null   | Sets the total number of reviews to display. Example: `View 499 reviews` where `499` is the total.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -
| `isUserRating`      | `Boolean` |    No    |  false  | Sets the rating as `(You)` to indicate the rating viewed was left by the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | -
