# Content Cards (f-content-cards)

## Introduction

The content cards component is a headless vue component that takes an array of adapters (functions that return cards) and exposes the cards collected from these adapters via the slot prop `cards`. The component also handles the tracking events for viewing and clicking cards, which are then sent back through to the relevant adapter.

## Structure

The component has the following folder structure

- cards (folder for new cards to be placed in)
- cardTemplates (deprecated folder for older cards not yet updated)
- templates (components which are sections of content cards, used to make cards)
- ContentCards.js (Main headless component)

## Main Component (ContentCards.js)

### Props

| Name     | Type   | Required | Default       | Purpose                                                                                           |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| adapters | Array  | true     | N/A           | Array of Objects conforming to the adapter interface (Refer to Adapters Section for more details) |
| locale   | String | true     | N/A           | Users tenant, used for i18n                                                                       |
| tags     | String | false    | content-cards | Provides tags for logging                                                                         |
| filters  | Array  | false    | []            | Filters provided cards                                                                            |

### Events

| Name               | Event Data | Description |
|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| has-loaded         |            |             |
| on-error           |            |             |
| voucher-code-click |            |             |

### Slots

The `ContentCards` component makes heavy use of slots in order to surface different states of data retrieval

| Slot name | scoped data | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|:----------|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| loading   |     {}      | The loading slot can be used by the consuming code to surface a loading state to the user before card data has been retrieved                                       |
| default   |  { cards }  | The `default` slot is used to display the cards when they have been received from the cards source instance, or alternatively injected via the `custom-cards` prop. |
| no-cards  |     {}      | The `no-cards` slot can be used to surface a message to the user when no cards have been received from the cards source(s)                                          |
| error     |     {}      | The `error` slot can be used by the consuming code to surface a message to the user when an error has been encountered upon initialising the cards source instance  |


### Data

The `state` property is set to the current state of the content cards component, using one of four states to show one of the corresponding four slots. For example `STATE_NO_CARDS` shows the no cards slot.

The `cards` array is where all the cards from all adapters are pushed into so that it can be exposed as a slot prop.

The `errors` array is used to push errors onto which occur while retrieving cards from the adapters in the `adapters` array.

The `cardObserver` is an object that holds the information about intersection time and whether its intersecting using the cards id. (esentually the viewing time and when it comes on screen and off-screen.)

### Watchers

The `errors` property is watched so that we can update the components state to show the correct slot

## Adapters

AN example of how to use the adapters can be found here https://github.com/justeattakeaway/content-cards-web/blob/main/packages/adapters/braze/README.md

## Prerequisites

### Vue

This component requires Vue to render. This can either be implemented as part of an existing Vue application or as a micro front-end.

If implementing Vue as part of a static application, we recommend using the following CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.11"></script>
```

> More information can be found at [https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Direct-lt-script-gt-Include](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Direct-lt-script-gt-Include)

### yarn

This package is a lerna monorepo that makes use of yarn workspaces.

yarn can be installed with the following curl script:

```bash
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

> More information can be found at [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

## Usage

### Installation

This package can be installed using npm or yarn:

```bash
# npm
$ npm i @justeat/f-content-cards

# yarn
$ yarn add @justeat/f-content-cards
```

### Vue Applications

You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

```js
import { ContentCards } from '@justeat/f-content-cards';
import '@justeat/f-content-cards/dist/f-content-cards.css';

export default {
    components: {
        ContentCards
    }
}
```

If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the header bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

```
import '@justeat/f-content-cards/dist/f-content-cards.css';

export default {
    components: {
        ...
        ContentCards: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "f-content-cards" */ '@justeat/f-content-cards')
    }
}
```

## Cards

The following 'cards' are given as named exports by this package, for use by consuming
applications within the contained slots:

* `FirstTimeCustomerCard`
* `PromotionCard`
* `PostOrderCard`
* `SkeletonLoader`
* `TermsAndConditionsCard`
* `VoucherCard`
* `HomePromotionCard1`
* `HomePromotionCard2`
