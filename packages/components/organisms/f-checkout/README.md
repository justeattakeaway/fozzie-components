## Usage

1.  Install the module using NPM or Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add @justeat/f-checkout
    ```

    ```bash
    npm install @justeat/f-checkout
    ```

2.  Import the component and its module, ensuring the latter is registered in the Vuex store upon creation.

    You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

    ```
    import { VueCheckout, CheckoutModule } from '@justeat/f-checkout';
    import '@justeat/f-checkout/dist/f-checkout.css';

    export default {
        components: {
            VueCheckout
        },

        created () {
            if (!this.$store.hasModule('checkout')) {
                this.$store.registerModule('checkout', CheckoutModule);
            }
        },
    }
    ```

    If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the `vue-checkout` bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

    ```
    import '@justeat/f-checkout/dist/f-checkout.css';

    export default {
        components: {
            ...
            VueCheckout: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "vue-checkout" */ '@justeat/f-checkout')
        }
    }

    ```

```bash
# cd ./fozzie-components
yarn install

## Testing
Unit / Integration / Contract

```bash
# Run Unit / Integration / Contract tests for all components
cd ./fozzie-components
yarn test
```

OR

```bash
# Run Unit / Integration / Contract tests for f-checkout
cd ./fozzie-components/packages/f-checkout
yarn test
```

Component Tests
```bash
# Run Component tests for all components
# Note: Ensure Storybook is not running when running the following commands

yarn storybook:serve-static
yarn test-component:chrome
```

OR

```bash
# Run Component tests for f-checkout
# Note: Ensure Storybook is not running when running the following commands
