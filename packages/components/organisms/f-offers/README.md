## Usage

### Installation

Install the module using npm or Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @justeat/f-offers
```

```sh
npm install @justeat/f-offers
```



### Vue Applications

You can import it in your Vue SFC like this (please note that styles have to be imported separately):

```js
import VOffers from '@justeat/f-offers';
import '@justeat/f-offers/dist/f-offers.css';

export default {
    components: {
        VOffers
    }
}
```

If you are using Webpack, you can import the component dynamically to separate the `v-offers` bundle from the main `bundle.client.js`:

```js
import '@justeat/f-offers/dist/f-offers.css';

export default {
    components: {
        // â€¦
        VOffers: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "v-offers" */ '@justeat/f-offers')
    }
}
```
